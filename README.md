# UFDN-TCGA

The code we used to train a UFDN on The Cancer Genome Atlas 

https://github.com/Alexander-H-Liu/UFDN
We used Liu et al's implementation has a basis for ours but had to modify their PyTorch code to accommodate an arbitrary number of domains. This code is in the folder src. 

The rest of the code in this repository is our own. Data is available here https://www.dropbox.com/s/5q6q0qy88tnpxf6/tcga_01_clipped.h5?dl=0
