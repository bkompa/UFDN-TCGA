# UFDN-TCGA
This repo contains the code associated with the following paper (under review):

> Kompa, B., Coker B. 2019. Learning a Latent Space of Highly Multidimensional Cancer Data. An early version of this work is available at arXiv preprint arXiv:1901.06023.

The code we used to train a Unified Feature Disentagnlement Network (UFDN) on The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)

https://github.com/Alexander-H-Liu/UFDN
We used Liu et al's implementation has a basis for ours but had to modify their PyTorch code to accommodate an arbitrary number of domains. This code is in the folder src. 

The rest of the code in this repository is our own. Data is available here https://www.dropbox.com/s/5q6q0qy88tnpxf6/tcga_01_clipped.h5?dl=0
